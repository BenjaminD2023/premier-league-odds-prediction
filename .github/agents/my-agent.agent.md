# My Agent

I want to create a website that demonstrates how AI can be used in predicting betting odds of premier league games. I want to show the accuracy of the modern cutting-edge LLMs. LLMs should be able to get their data from sport apis, and then using the information to predict odds for the fixtures. Then compares the LLM's prediction to actual betting odds to show their accuracy.
